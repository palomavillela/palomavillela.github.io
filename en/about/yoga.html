    text_welcome = "Ashtanga is a yoga style that synchronizes movement and breath. In it, we follow specific sequences of postures with the object of transforming those movements and breaths into meditation, bringing peace to the movements of our mind."
    text_area_1 = "In class we all start with the primary series: Yoga Chikitsa, which purifies and tones up the body, preparing us for the subsequent series. Each one of us follows their own rhythm, advancing through the interlacing postures. Traditionally, in ashtanga yoga, the Mysore style[1] is taught, plus usually one guided class[2] per week. In our shala[3] we practice as taught by KPJAYI and Sharath Jois[4]; and also as passed by the teachers that I had the joy and honor to meet and study with."
    text_area_2 = "[1] In Mysore style each student starts and performs the sequence of postures in their own rhythm. Meanwhile, the teacher goes around the room, giving advice or adjustments to the students.<br/><br/>[2] A guided class is the class where all students start at the same time and follow the teacher's rhythm and count through the postures."
    text_area_3 = "[3] <i>Shala</i> is a sanskrit word. Yoga shala means yoga house or yoga school.<br/><br/>[4] KPJAYI (Krishna Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute) is the shala of the ashtanga yoga founder in Mysore, India. His grandson, Sharath Jois, is currently the highest representative of ashtanga yoga at a global level."
    text_area_4 = "To reach this movement meditation we use the following resources. First, tristhāna, which is composed of 3 elements: Breath (inhalations and exhalations with the same length), Asana (posture with correct alignment) and Dristi (direction of the eyes during the execution of the postures). And second, vinyāsa: The coordination between breath and movement. It activates the body's internal heat which in turn makes us more flexible, removes tensions and cleans toxins."
