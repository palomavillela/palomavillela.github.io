In this style we give a lot of emphasys in establishing a self-practice capacity with the student, an understanding of one's own body and requirements, with the help and close guidance of the teacher at all times."
    text_area_1 = "In class we all start with the primary series: Yoga Chikitsa, which purifies and tones up the body, preparing us for the subsequent series. Each one of us follows their own rhythm, advancing through the interlacing postures. In ashtanga yoga, there are Mysore style[1] classes, and guided classes[2]. In our shala[3] we practice based on the teachings of Sharath Jois[4], and other teachers that I had the joy and honor to meet and study with."
    text_area_2 = "[1] In Mysore style each student starts and performs the sequence of postures in their own rhythm. Meanwhile, the teacher goes around the room, giving advice or adjustments to the students.<br/><br/>[2] A guided class is the class where all students start at the same time and follow the teacher's rhythm and count through the postures."
    text_area_3 = "[3] <i>Shala</i> is a sanskrit word. Yoga shala means yoga house or yoga school.<br/><br/>[4] Sharath Jois is the grandson of the founder of ashtanga yoga in Mysore, India. And him, together with her mother Saraswathi, are nowadays the highest representatives of ashtanga yoga at a global level."
    text_area_4 = "To reach this movement meditation we use the following resources. First, tristhāna, which is composed of 3 elements: Breath (inhalations and exhalations with the same length), Asana (posture with correct alignment) and Dristi (direction of the eyes during the execution of the postures). And second, vinyāsa: The coordination between breath and movement. It activates the body's internal heat which in turn makes us more flexible, removes tensions and cleans toxins."
