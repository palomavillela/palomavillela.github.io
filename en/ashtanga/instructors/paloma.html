    text_area_1 = "I started my studies and professional life as an artist. And although I felt good doing what I did, I had the feeling that something was missing. In 2006 I found yoga. I started practicing with Xavier Sola and Pilar Ruberte. And in their shala I discovered, with Nick Evans and Eva Oller, ashtanga yoga. It was love on first sight. They taught me the base of what my practice is today. In 2007/2008 I took part of the teacher training course of Yoga Studio Barcelona. Nevertheless, my heart always belonged to the practice of ashtanga."
    text_area_2 = "In 2015 I met Pepe M. MÃ¡s, who was my ashtanga teacher for 3 years. He helped me consolidate my practice to 6 days per week. Also, he gave me the opportunity to assist him in his shala for two years. In 2016, 2017 and 2018 I was in Mysore (India) to study with Sharath Jois and I hope to return there many more years to celebrate that beautiful community."
    text_area_3 = "Nowadays, I practice at home and maintain my yoga studies through workshops with different advanced teachers. I enjoyed and had the honor of studying with inspiring teachers like Brett Porzio, Jordan Turner, Sharmila Desai, Rolf and Marci Naujokat and David Garrigues, in addition to Sharath."
    text_area_4 = "And even if I started ashtanga a bunch of years ago, the discipline, the understanding of what this practice represents to me, and the deepest care with it, started only about 5 years ago. In them, I could clearly recognize the change in my body and mind. And I'll always be grateful to all the teachers who I had the honor to meet, and who taught me this path full of discipline and challenges, but above all, full of love."
