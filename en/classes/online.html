Thus, you'll need one of these devices with a camera and an internet connection, as well as some space to extend your yoga mat. Before the class, the teacher will pass you a link to enter the conference room. Group classes have limited attendance, so that the teacher can give attention to all students."

We offer a FREE discovery class (it's private, 30-minutes-long and online), so that you get to know the teacher and her method, and have the chance to ask any questions. Arrange your discovery class now :-) we're eager to meet you!"
